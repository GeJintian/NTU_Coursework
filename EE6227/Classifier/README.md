# Introduction
In this project, I choose to implement Bayes Decision Rule and LDA. So, the submitted files include: Bayes_Decision_Rule.py, Bayes_Decision_Rule_result.txt, Fisher_LDA.py, Fisher_LDA_result.txt.<br>
In training set, the accuracy of Bayes Decision Rule is 98.3 and the accuracy of LDA is 85.
# How to run
To run Bayes_Decision_Rule.py, use<br>
```python Bayes_Decision_Rule.py```<br>
To run Fisher_LDA.py, use<br>
```python Fisher_LDA.py```<br>
Notice that in default, dataset should be placed in the same directory of these two files. Their name should be: Data_test.mat, Data_Train.mat, Label_Train.mat. If you want to change the path to your dataset, please find *TODO* using "CTRL+F", and follow the instruction.
